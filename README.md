# Node.jsAppLab
## Results and Overall Findings:
I enjoyed this lab and found the overall experience to be positive.<br/>


This was my second time working with Node.js and I enjoyed completing the MySQl portion and doing url parameters. 
I never knew how easy it was to do variable endpoint.


My group only had a problem when completing Step 5.<br/> 
It appears that you don't need to include the following code at the top of the app.js file for this step.
```javascript
const routes = require('./routes/routes');
```
